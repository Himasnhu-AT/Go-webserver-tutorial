## Documentation: Simple HTTP Server

This code is a simple implementation of an HTTP server in the Go programming language. It sets up a server that listens on port 9000 and responds with a "Hello, World!" message when accessed.

### Package and Imports

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)
```

The code begins with the `package main` declaration, indicating that this is the main package of the Go program. The `import` statement imports the necessary packages, `fmt` for formatting and printing, and `net/http` for building HTTP servers and handling HTTP requests.

### Constants

```go
const Port = ":9000"
```

The code declares a constant variable `Port` and assigns the value `:9000` to it. This constant represents the port on which the server will listen for incoming HTTP requests.

### Request Handler Function

```go
func Home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	response := "Hello, World!"
	fmt.Fprintf(w, response)
}
```

The `Home` function is a request handler function, which will be invoked whenever a request is made to the server's root URL ("/"). It takes two arguments: `w`, an `http.ResponseWriter` object used to send the response back to the client, and `r`, an `*http.Request` object representing the incoming request.

In this function, a string variable `response` is assigned the value "Hello, World!". The `fmt.Fprintf` function is then used to write the `response` string to the `http.ResponseWriter`, which sends it as the response to the client.

### Main Function

```go
func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", Home)
	http.ListenAndServe(Port, nil)
}
```

The `main` function is the entry point of the Go program. It sets up the server by registering the `Home` function as the request handler for the root URL ("/") using `http.HandleFunc`.

The `http.ListenAndServe` function starts the server and listens for incoming HTTP requests on the specified `Port`. The second argument, `nil`, indicates that the default server configuration should be used.

### Usage

To use this code, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Save the code in a file with a `.go` extension, such as `server.go`. Then, navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start running, and you can access it by opening a web browser and visiting `http://localhost:9000`. The browser should display the message "Hello, World!" as the response from the server.

You can stop the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window where it is running.
